# Ballytrent House
Web page for Ballytrent House, wedding and events location in Co. Wexford, Ireland.

## Demo
The live site can be found [here](https://www.ballytrentevents.com/)

## UX
This project provides Ballyrent Events with an online presence where users can read about the services offered by Ballytrent Events, view photos from the location and find links to contact the property owners with any queries they may have. 
My goal in the design of this website was to make it as easy as possible for users to access critical information about the location while keeping the overall design clean and minamilist. To achieve this, I kept most elements with a background color of white and a light grey to highlight the navigation bar. 
Users can browse the four pages for this website (Home, Weddings & Events, Galley and Contact Us) using the header and footer navigation bars. Each page delivers information to the user, while allowing the website to be seperated into distinct sections. I also made use of the CSS grid system to provide the user with a simple responsive image gallery.  

## Features:

**Existing Features** 

  * Mobile-first layout
  * Responsive design
  * Interactive map
  * Parallax image effect
  * CSS grid for photo gallery


**Features Left to Implement**

  * Email form to replace email icon on contact page
  * Calendar to allow users to book time for an event/viewing


## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* [Bootstrap (4.3.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * This project used Bootstrap 4 to simplify page styling and maintain uniform features throughout the site

## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge). 
Using the Chrome and Firefox developer tools, multiple device sizes were also tested to ensure responsiveness.

Clicking contact icon links open in a new tab using 'target=_blank'. Email icon and link will open the users default mail program and pre-fill 'To:' and 'Subject' lines. All other links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.
